Extension of the Ruby's default Net::FTP class.


Some of the code is based on https://github.com/bmarzolf/ftputils gem, thanks to Bruz Marzolf.

Changes from Net::FTP

* Support for custom ports
* mkdir_p command (recursive mkdir)
* rm_r command (recursive rm)
* cd command as an alias to chdir
* reconnect! method
* directory? and file? methods
* Support for custom host IP for PORT command
* Expanding of paths with ~ in mkdir_p command (rm_r coming)


Installation

Just copy the damn file for now. Will make it a gem later if it grows useful.
